properties:
  cf4-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      This property specifies the connection for CF4, because the
      Zephyr driver maps all interrupts to CF4.  The signal defaults
      to output low when produced by the sensor
  
  irq1-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      This property specifies the connection for IRQ1, because the
      Zephyr driver maps all interrupts to IRQ1.  The signal defaults
      to output low when produced by the sensor
